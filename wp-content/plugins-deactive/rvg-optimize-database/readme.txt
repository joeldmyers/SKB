== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I change the settings of this plugin? =

* Click the 'Optimize DB (1 click)' link in the Admin Bar (if enabled)

= Why do I see 'InnoDB table: skipped...'? =
* That's because optimizing InnoDB tables is not really efficient, so change the table type to MyISAM to have them being optimized.

= I scheduled the optimization for 8pm but it runs at 6pm (my local time) =
* The scheduler uses the local time of the web server which can differ from your own local time
